# odin-recipes

This project serves as my first project on ***The Odin's Project***. It only requires the basic HTML knowlege. I shall use this opportunity to practice:

1. Use of GIT
2. Basic HTML
3. Try to do atomic commit and write good commit message

The result project contains three Sichuan style recipes I cook often in real life,

1. Fried Egg with Spinat
2. Fried Chilli and Porks
3. Seaweed and Egg Soup
